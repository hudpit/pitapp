 * ## Overview
 * Survey Help Panel.
 *
 * Sencha Touch uses views for user interaction.  From the user's perspective the application is just a series of views.  [Read more about Sencha Touch Views](http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2.4/components/views.html). The survey help panel is used to display help text about completing surveys.
