Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS) are of great help in quantifying the work being done in HUD funded programs but they lack the breadth of coverage of the PIT. A key aspect of the PIT count is the count of individuals and households living on the street.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, communities have each approached the street count using teams of volunteers armed with paper forms. There is an inherent simplicity to this approach however there are limitations to the knowledge that can be gained including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is an inconsistency as to how questions are asked on one region’s forms to another.</li>\n<li>HUD continuum of care often cross multiple census tracts and the paper counting forms typically ignore these tract boundaries. Due to this, the PIT data cannot be compared against census data.</li>\n<li>The process of compiling counts from multiple paper sheets can be labor intensive.</li>\n<li>The underlying data that comprised these counts is not stored in a manner that allows for it to be revisited in the future. This year’s PIT count has a new question to count the number of female veterans. If client-level data existed for prior years a query could be written to determine the change in the counts of female veterans even though that specific question was never asked before.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, these shortfalls of the paper forms can be addressed thanks to the advent of mobile based data gathering tools such as the point in time mobile app when used in conjunction with a centralized data management platform to gather and process the information.</p>\n","title":"Accessing The Code"});
