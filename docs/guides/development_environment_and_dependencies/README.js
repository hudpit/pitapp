The JRE Is provided as included with the Sencha CMD download.</p>\n\n<p>Ruby is required to restyle the app using Compass.  Compass and Ruby requirements are outlined in the CMD documentation: <a href=\"http://docs.sencha.com/cmd/6.x/intro_to_cmd.html\">http://docs.sencha.com/cmd/6.x/intro_to_cmd.html</a></p>\n\n<h2 id='development_environment_and_dependencies-section-apache-cordova'>Apache Cordova</h2>\n\n<p>Point In Time was designed to be compatible with Apache Cordova CLI 5.1.1</p>\n\n<p>Apache Cordova is a set of device APIs that allow a mobile app developer to access native device function such as the camera or accelerometer from JavaScript. Combined with a UI framework such as jQuery Mobile or Dojo Mobile or Sencha Touch, this allows a smartphone app to be developed with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>When using the Cordova APIs, an app can be built without any native code (Java, Objective-C, etc.) from the app developer. Instead, web technologies are used, and they are hosted in the app itself locally (generally not on a remote http server).</p>\n\n<p>And because these JavaScript APIs are consistent across multiple device platforms and built on web standards, the app should be portable to other device platforms with minimal to no changes.</p>\n\n<p>Apps using Cordova are still packaged as apps using the platform SDKs, and can be made available for installation from each device's app store.</p>\n\n<p>Cordova provides a set of uniform JavaScript libraries that can be invoked, with device-specific native backing code for those JavaScript libraries. Cordova is available for the following platforms: iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone, Palm WebOS, Bada, and Symbian.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to use Cordova in your mobile application, take a look at their documentation. It includes Getting Started guides, the JavaScript APIs reference and examples, instructions on Upgrading from previous versions of Cordova, how to write your own Cordova plugin, and more. The selector in the top-right corner of the documentation will let you pick different Cordova versions and language translations. And there is a registry of third-party plugins that can be used in your mobile application.</p>\n\n<p>Adobe Cordova 5.1.1 Documentation:\n<a href=\"http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.1.1/index.html\">http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.1.1/index.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Apache Cordova graduated in October 2012 as a top level project within the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).

PhoneGap solves this by using standards-based web technologies to bridge web applications and mobile devices. Since PhoneGap apps are standards compliant, they’re future-proofed to work with browsers as they evolve.</p>\n\n<p>PhoneGap explained visually:\n<a href=\"http://phonegap.com/2012/05/02/phonegap-explained-visually/\">http://phonegap.com/2012/05/02/phonegap-explained-visually/</a></p>\n\n<p>The PhoneGap code was contributed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under the name Apache Cordova and graduated to top-level project status in October 2012.

This file includes a public encryption key that is matched with the private key file that you will create using a Digital Signing Utility.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Private Key file</strong>  - The private key (PK) file is created at the same time as the CSR file. It is used in the MyEclipse Mobile Tools application build process to encrypt the key file. This file should be kept safe and private.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Digital Certificate file</strong> - An iOS application must be digitally signed with a valid digital certificate provided by Apple in order for it to install and run successfully on an iOS device. This file includes the public encryption key provided by the CSR file.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Provision Profile file</strong> - In addition to the digital signature requirement, an application can be installed and run only on iOS devices configured with a provision profile (e.g., distribution.mobile-provision) that authorizes the application. A provision profile is a document that lists the digital certificates, the devices, and the IDs of the applications allowed to operate on a device.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>You can read about iOS Signing on Phonegap Build:\n<a href=\"http://docs.build.phonegap.com/en_US/signing_signing-ios.md.html\">http://docs.build.phonegap.com/en_US/signing_signing-ios.md.html</a></p>\n\n<h3 id='development_environment_and_dependencies-section-apple-ios-developer-program-membership-requirement'>Apple iOS Developer Program Membership Requirement</h3>\n\n<p>A membership in the Apple iOS Developer Program is required to access the iOS Provision Portal, a data creation service used in this tutorial.
