# Recommendations

The Point In Time mobile app is designed to be used in conjunction with the PIT Control Panel.

Sencha CMD should be used for software lifecycle functions, production builds and native packaging.

The application has been tested with PhoneGap Build configured for PhoneGap CLI 5.1.1, Cordova should work also.

Native builds should be deployed to modern Google Android or Apple iOS devices, but older models should work adequately, support for Windows Mobile and Blackberry 10 is not included but the code should work fine, maybe a few tweaks would be required.

Apple IOS 8, 7 and 6 have been tested.

Google Android Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, KitKat & Lollipop (versions 4-5.1.1 , API Levels 14-22 respectively) have been tested. Older or newer operating systems should function also.

Adobe PhoneGap Build was used for native deployment, it has many advantages over regular native packaging, builds happen remotely, the software and plugins are kept up to date and functionality is offered for testing and collaboration.

GapDebug is by Genuitec is a useful tool for PhoneGap application debugging [https://www.genuitec.com/products/gapdebug/](https://www.genuitec.com/products/gapdebug/).

If using PhoneGap Build, keep an eye on the [PhoneGap Build Blog](http://phonegap.com/blog/phonegap-build/) for updates.
